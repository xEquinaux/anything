+ Visuals.
The premise is going to be top-down, 2.5D.
Imagine walking through the forest with trees partially occluding the forest floor below (maybe made translucent for viewing the player). There's ponds here and there.
The overworld might as well have a Z coordinate for height and jumping/slope/climbing elements.
Each dynamic element will be completely 2D. Trees and folliage will be 2.5D.
The dynamic elements will cast a type of shadow onto the floor below it.
Daytime dynamics for the overworld -- leading to different mob types or danger.
Likely to be traps in each dungeon.
The way the player and objects are drawn will be to face the viewport, not the direction something is moving on the X or Y axis. Only facing the Z axis without rotation. These entities do not "look" left or right either.
Entering a dungeon occludes all the overworld around it from the viewport. Each dungeon is not instanced. Each layer will be integrated into either the overworld or through each floor--a floor being dynamically loaded in realtime, below and/or above the floor the player is on; only visibility on the current floor.
+ Overworld.
There are five biomes in the overworld. Each region has a type of dungeons.

+ Mechanics.
Click to slash. Maybe a bow weapon for hold mouse click to charge, release to fire.
Time only changes with the speed of the player (time scaling). If moving, or resting, time moves. Stopping movement = time stopped. Hold a key to let time move while velocity is zero to update.
Resting will be realtime and will move the time at an increased rate--more time spent resting = more healing is applied. Maybe rest for mana too / x2 multiplier on how much is restored per "minute" of resting.
Moving also is rated at the same as resting, but without time dilation.
Each dungeon is infinite.
